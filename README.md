I built this app as part of Stephen Griders 'Modern React with Redux Course as a learning exercise'

It is built using Create React App

Basic Design:

A React App with a local json server. Using Redux Toolkit to fetch, modify and store data from the server, and primarily Tailwind CSS for styling.

Additional Libraries used in the making of this app:

JSON Server
Redux Toolkit
React-Redux
Redux Toolkit Query React
React Icons
Axios
Tailwind CSS
Classnames
Faker (to generate site content quickly and easily)

To run the server: npm run start:server
To run the App: npm run start

What I Learnt:
This was an incredibly interesting project, consolidating my react knowledge of components, custom hooks and state. 
It also introduced me to Redux, using the redux store as opposed to context. 
It taught me how to build Slices and use Thunks, as well as using redux toolkit query to create apis, and modify and use the tag system to efficently manage my content.
